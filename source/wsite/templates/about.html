          	Hi there, I am here again with a new project. I was learning Django, So I have decided to create a project side by side by implimenting things I was reading about.<br>
            In this project I'm using Bootstrap(v4.0) with Fontawesome(v4.7) for front-end development, Chart.js(v2.8) for data visualization and back-end is powered by Django 3.2 and SQLite.
        	</p>
            <b>Concept:</b><br>
            <ul>
            	<li>Admin is main user. He has authority to create a new user or modify data of an existing account.</li>
            	<li>Admin can lock, unlock, suspend or activate user accounts.</li>
            	<li>Admin has access to see account statistics.</li>
            </ul>
        	</p>
        </div>
	</section>
</div>
